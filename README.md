it 16 december, anyone who has access to the internet and did not go to chrisbrown concert can join and build this challenge

Build a note-taking application with a reminder feature:

The user must log in to view their notes.
The user can add, delete, and update notes.
By default, when adding a note, it will not have a reminder. However, if the user wishes, they can set a reminder and specify how many days before the event they should be notified.

feel free to invite in your project,
feel free to use any tech for this...

here are applications to train your java skills

Number Guessing Game

Description: Create a simple game where the computer randomly generates a number, and the user has to guess it within a set number of attempts.

Key Concepts:
Random number generation
Loops and conditionals (for checking if the guess is correct)
User input validation

==========>

 Student Grade Calculator

Description: Create a console program where you input a studentâ€™s grades (e.g., test scores) and calculate their average, determine their grade, and print a report card.

Key Concepts:
Arrays or ArrayLists to store grades
Loops for processing input and calculating averages
Conditional statements to determine the letter grade (A, B, C, etc.)

==========>

Simple Quiz Application

Description:  Build a multiple-choice quiz application where users can answer questions and get a score at the end.

Key Concepts:
Arrays or ArrayLists to store questions and answers
Loops to ask questions and tally scores
Conditional logic to check answers


==========>

Password Strength Checker

Description: Create a program that checks if a given password is strong based on criteria like length, use of numbers, special characters, and uppercase letters.

Key Concepts:
String manipulation (checking for certain characters)
Regular expressions for pattern matching (optional)
Conditional logic for checking password strength


==========>

Tips for Success:

Start simple: Begin with the core functionality and add features gradually as you become comfortable with Java.

Practice OOP: Even in console applications, you can structure your code with classes and objects to improve readability and reusability.

Error handling: Use try-catch blocks where necessary to handle invalid user inputs and unexpected errors.

Use basic data structures: Arrays and ArrayLists are essential for storing data and will help you understand how to manage collections of information in Java.

Soldiers, push when no one is watching..
feel free to invite me in your repos like Paul phoenix did

it a personal challenge, do not do them all
select the one u like then push
do it for fun when you are alone

DO IT ONLY WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH SECTION 2 in JAVA
those who want to make use of database then do it when you are done with section 4
